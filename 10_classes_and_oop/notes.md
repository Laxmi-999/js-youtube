- javascript and classes 
 <!-- -Yes, JavaScript supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It is not a purely object-oriented language but rather a multi-paradigm language that allows you to write code in procedural, functional, and object-oriented styles. -->


 - objects: 
  <!-- collection of properties and method
 - eg:toLowerCase(),toUpperCase() -->


 -  why use OOP 
 <!-- - creation of reusable classes and modules.
 - Improved Code Maintainability.
 - Encapsulation Protects data by restricting direct access and provides controlled interfaces.
 -  Abstraction Simplifies complex systems by providing clear interfaces and hiding unnecessary implementation details.
 - Polymorphism Allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class.-->

 - parts of OOP
   - object literals.
   - constructor function.
   - prototypes.
   - classes.
   - instances(new, this).

  - 4 pillars of oop
   <!-- 
   1. Abstraction
   2. inheritance.
   3. Encapsulation.
   4. Polymorphism.
